## ðŸ§© What to Bring

Come ready to share your **Data Story** and ideas for integration!  
Your preparation will help make the discussions richer, more focused, and more useful for everyone.

### ðŸ“– Your Data Story
Think of this as a brief personal introduction to your work with data. You do **not** need to prepare slides or a formal write-up â€” just have these points in mind:

1. **The Data You Work With**
   - What kind of **social, behavioral, economic, hazard, or climate-related data** do you use?  
     _(Example: Public survey results on hurricane evacuation, NWS warning polygons, FEMA disaster claims, social media sentiment during severe weather events.)_

2. **Integration Challenges or Opportunities**
   - Where do you see the most potential for combining your data with other datasets?  
   - What technical, policy, or cultural barriers make integration difficult?  
     _(Example: Geospatial misalignment between survey areas and hazard data, restricted data access, lack of metadata.)_

3. **Collaboration Interests**
   - What types of partners or disciplines would you like to connect with?  
     _(Example: Partnering with atmospheric scientists to model public response to heat advisories, or with economists to quantify storm recovery impacts.)_

### ðŸ“Š A Dataset & a Question
Identify a dataset youâ€™ve created or worked with â€” **real or hypothetical** â€” and think through how integration might expand its value.

1. **The Dataset**
   - Whatâ€™s in it? (Variables, time range, geography)  
   - Who collects it, and how often?  
     _(Example: A 5-year dataset of household flood insurance claims by ZIP code, collected annually.)_

2. **The Question**
   - What could you learn by combining your dataset with **other** data sources?  
     _(Example: Could integrating flood insurance data with precipitation records and social vulnerability indices help target community outreach before flood season?)_
   - You do not need to identify the exact data sources â€” just think about **what type** of data might answer your question.

3. **Action Step**
   - Jot down a few bullet points before the Forums so you can quickly share your dataset and question with the group.

ðŸ’¡ **Why This Matters**  
Weâ€™ll use your Data Stories and dataset questions to:
- Kick off **Forum 1** with real-world examples from our community
- Kick off **Forum 2** with the range of datasets our community is focused on
- Showcase the diversity of SBES and hazard-related data being used
- Identify common integration challenges and opportunities
- Seed potential collaborations that extend beyond the event
