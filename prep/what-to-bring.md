## ðŸ§© What to Bring

Come ready to share your **Data Story** and ideas for integration!

- **Your Data Story**  
  What kind of social, behavioral, or hazard-related data do you work with?  
  What are your biggest integration challenges or opportunities?  
  What new collaborations would you like to see?  

- **A Dataset & a Question**  
  Think of a dataset youâ€™ve created or worked with (real or hypothetical).  
  Pose a question that could be answered by combining it with additional data sources.

ðŸ’¡ Weâ€™ll use these reflections to kick off Forum 1 and spark collaboration across the community.
