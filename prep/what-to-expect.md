# 📅 What to Expect

The **SSP Data Forums** are designed to be **approachable, interactive, and practical** — whether you’re new to data integration or already using advanced workflows.

## 🗓 Format & Schedule
- **Two 2-hour virtual sessions** held on consecutive days (September 24 & 25, 2025)
- Hosted on **Vimeo** with live presentations, demos, and Q&A
- Materials and recordings will be made available after the sessions

## 🧠 Session Goals
- **Forum 1 – Data Generation & Stewardship**  
  Learn how to apply draft metadata standards, explore why metadata matters for discovery and reuse, and practice adding metadata to your own datasets using Jupyter notebooks.
  
- **Forum 2 – Data Reuse & Workflows**  
  See examples of SBES data integrated with weather/climate datasets, walk through a reproducible workflow in a Jupyter notebook, and discuss best practices for making your data integration-ready.

## 💻 Hands-On Components
- Guided Jupyter notebook exercises
- Step-by-step examples that you can adapt to your own research
- Opportunities to test metadata tools with sample datasets

## 🤝 Community Building
- Meet others in the **social, behavioral, and economic sciences** community working with hazard and weather data
- Share challenges, successes, and ideas for future collaboration
- Provide feedback to refine NOAA’s draft metadata standards

---

By the end of the Forums, you’ll have:
1. **Practical experience** applying metadata to datasets
2. **Example workflows** for reusing data alongside other sources
3. **Connections** with peers in the SBES and weather/hazard research community
4. A voice in shaping tools and standards to support future research
