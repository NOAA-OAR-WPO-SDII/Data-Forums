# 📅 What to Expect

The **SSP Data Forums** are designed to be **approachable, interactive, and practical** — whether you’re new to data integration or already using advanced workflows.

---

## 🗓 Format & Schedule
- **Two 2-hour virtual sessions** held on consecutive days (**September 24 & 25, 2025**)
- Hosted on **Vimeo** with live presentations, demos, and Q&A
- Materials and recordings will be made available after the sessions

---

## 🧠 Session Goals
- **Forum 1 – Data Generation & Stewardship**  
  Learn how to apply draft metadata standards, explore why metadata matters for discovery and reuse, and practice adding metadata to your own datasets using Jupyter notebooks.
  
- **Forum 2 – Data Reuse & Workflows**  
  See examples of SBES data integrated with weather/climate datasets, walk through a reproducible workflow in a Jupyter notebook, and discuss best practices for making your data integration-ready.

---

## 💻 Hands-On Components
- Guided Jupyter notebook exercises
- Step-by-step examples you can adapt to your own research
- Opportunities to test metadata tools with sample datasets

---

## 🧩 **Come Prepared**  
To make the Data Forums more relevant for your work, we invite participants to reflect on the following as they engage in the Forums (see also [🧩 What to Bring](what-to-bring.md)):  

1. **Your Data Story**  
   - What kind of social, behavioral, economic, hazard, or climate-related data do you work with?  
   - What are your biggest integration challenges or opportunities?  
   - How well documented is your data? Could improving or enriching your **metadata** make integration easier?  
   - What new collaborations would you like to see?  

2. **Looking Ahead: A Dataset & a Question**  
   - After the Forums, begin thinking about a dataset you’ve created or worked with (real or hypothetical).  
   - Consider what new insights might come from combining it with other data sources.  
   - Reflect on what types of data (social, meteorological, environmental, etc.) could help answer those questions.  

💡 **Why This Matters**  
By keeping these reflections in mind during the Forums, you’ll be better positioned to:  
- Connect discussions to your own data and challenges  
- Recognize common opportunities across disciplines  
- See how metadata and documentation support collaboration  
- Carry forward ideas that could grow into future projects, partnerships, or even a **community directory or network map** to strengthen SBES connections  

---

## 🤝 Community Building
- Meet others in the **social, behavioral, and economic sciences** community working with hazard and weather data
- Share challenges, successes, and ideas for future collaboration
- Provide feedback to refine NOAA’s draft metadata standards

---

## 📌 By the end of the Forums, you’ll have:
1. **Practical experience** applying metadata to datasets  
2. **Example workflows** for reusing data alongside other sources  
3. **Connections** with peers in the SBES and weather/hazard research community  
4. A voice in shaping tools and standards to support future research
