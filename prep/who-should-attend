# Who Should Attend

The Data Forums are designed to be **accessible and inclusive**. No technical background is requiredâ€”our goal is to make concepts like metadata and data integration approachable for all participants.  

These forums are especially relevant for:

- **NOAA Social Scientists**  
  Those working across NOAA programs who are interested in learning how to better document, connect, and reuse social science data related to hazards and weather.  

- **NOAA-Funded Awardees**  
  Researchers supported by NOAA grants who want to better understand metadata practices and how their data can be integrated with other NOAA or community datasets.  

- **Academic Social Scientists**  
  Faculty, students, and researchers from universities who work on the social dimensions of **natural hazards and weather** and want to explore connections between social and environmental data.  

## Why Attend?

- Learn the **basics of metadata** and why it matters for discoverability and reuse.  
- Gain a practical introduction to **data integration** concepts, with examples relevant to social science and hazard research.  
- Connect with colleagues across NOAA and the broader research community who are working on similar challenges.  

Whether you are new to working with data or simply looking to strengthen your understanding of metadata and integration practices, the Data Forums are an opportunity to grow your skills and expand your network.
