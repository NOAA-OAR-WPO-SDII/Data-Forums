# üìö Additional Resources

The Data Forums are an introduction to metadata and data integration for social scientists working with natural hazards and weather.  
If you are interested in exploring further, the following resources may be useful:

## Jupyter Notebooks
- [Neal Caren's Learning Python for Social Scientists](https://nealcaren.github.io/python-tutorials/) - A collection of Python notebook tutorials oriented for social scientists.
- [Github's Social Sciences Topic Page](https://github.com/topics/social-sciences) - A listing of Github repositories tagged as "social science", with many Juptyer notebooks.  You can also Use GitHub‚Äôs topic search (e.g., "Jupyter Notebook" + "social science") to discover additional notebooks.
-  [Awesome Computational Social Science](https://github.com/gesiscss/awesome-computational-social-science) - A curated list collecting a rich array of tutorials, books, software tools, and educational materials specifically for computational social science.

## Metadata and Data Standards
- [Inspire Metadata Scheme](https://noaa-oar-wpo-sdii.github.io/inspire-labs/metadata-schema/) ‚Äì A metadata framework developed under NOAA‚Äôs Inspire Labs initiative to promote consistent documentation of social science datasets.  
- [NOAA Data Documentation Guidance](https://data.noaa.gov) ‚Äì Overview of NOAA‚Äôs requirements and best practices for documenting datasets.  
- [FAIR Principles](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/) ‚Äì Guidelines to make data **Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable**.  
- [Dublin Core Metadata Initiative](https://www.dublincore.org/) ‚Äì Widely used metadata standard for describing digital resources.

## Data Repositories and Tools
- [DesignSafe-CI Data Depot](https://www.designsafe-ci.org/) ‚Äì Repository and platform for natural hazards engineering data.  
- [Generalist Repositories (NIH Guidance PDF)](https://datascience.nih.gov/sites/default/files/GREI-Webinar-1-Sept-2022-508.pdf) ‚Äì NIH-backed guidance on selecting a generalist repository for broad research data types.  
- [re3data.org](https://www.re3data.org/) ‚Äì Registry of research data repositories across all disciplines.  

## Training and Community
- [NOAA Library Training](https://library.noaa.gov/) ‚Äì Training opportunities and guides on data management and sharing.  
- [DataONE](https://www.dataone.org/education-modules) ‚Äì Educational modules and tools on data management, curation, and open science practices.  
- [Natural Hazards Center](https://hazards.colorado.edu/) ‚Äì Research and community hub focused on the human dimensions of hazards and disasters.

## Why Use Repositories? A Note on Open Science

Using trusted repositories is a key pillar of **open science**‚Äîit ensures that your data are **discoverable, preserved, and citable**. For example:
- Trusted repositories, like the **generalist repositories**, assign persistent identifiers (such as DOIs) and support reuse by applying open licensing and standardized metadata.  
- Tools like **DataONE** help you manage data workflows and align with FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) principles.  

Altogether, these resources will help you extend beyond the Data Forums‚Äîmoving from ‚Äúlearning about data‚Äù to **sharing and integrating** data in ways that benefit your community.
