# 📅 What to Expect

The **SSP Data Forums** are designed to be **approachable, interactive, and practical** — whether you’re new to data integration or already using advanced workflows.

---

## 🗓 Format & Schedule
- **Two 2-hour virtual sessions** held on consecutive days (**September 24 & 25, 2025**)
- Hosted on **Vimeo** with live presentations, demos, and Q&A
- Materials and recordings will be made available after the sessions

---

## 🧠 Session Goals
- **Forum 1 – Data Generation & Stewardship**  
  Learn how to apply draft metadata standards, explore why metadata matters for discovery and reuse, and practice adding metadata to your own datasets using Jupyter notebooks.
  
- **Forum 2 – Data Reuse & Workflows**  
  See examples of SBES data integrated with weather/climate datasets, walk through a reproducible workflow in a Jupyter notebook, and discuss best practices for making your data integration-ready.

---

## 💻 Hands-On Components
- Guided Jupyter notebook exercises
- Step-by-step examples you can adapt to your own research
- Opportunities to test metadata tools with sample datasets

---

## 🧩 **Come Prepared**
To make the discussions more relevant and collaborative, we ask that participants come ready to reflect on:

1. **Your Data Story**  
   - What kind of social, behavioral, or hazard-related data do you work with?  
   - What are your biggest integration challenges or opportunities?  
   - What new collaborations would you like to see?  

2. **A Dataset & a Question**  
   - Think of a dataset you’ve created or worked with (real or hypothetical).  
   - Pose a question that could be answered — at least in part — by integrating your dataset with additional data sources.  
   - Consider what kind of data (social, meteorological, environmental, etc.) could help answer it.

These reflections will spark the **opening discussion in Forum 1**, showcase the diversity of data across our community, and help identify future collaboration opportunities. Over time, they could even seed the beginnings of a **community directory or network map** to strengthen SBES connections.

---

## 🤝 Community Building
- Meet others in the **social, behavioral, and economic sciences** community working with hazard and weather data
- Share challenges, successes, and ideas for future collaboration
- Provide feedback to refine NOAA’s draft metadata standards

---

## 📌 By the end of the Forums, you’ll have:
1. **Practical experience** applying metadata to datasets  
2. **Example workflows** for reusing data alongside other sources  
3. **Connections** with peers in the SBES and weather/hazard research community  
4. A voice in shaping tools and standards to support future research
