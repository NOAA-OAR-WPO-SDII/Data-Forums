# 📅 What to Expect

The **SSP Data Forums** are designed to be **approachable and practical** — whether you’re new to data integration or already using advanced workflows.

---

## 🗓 Format & Schedule
- **Two 2-hour virtual sessions** held on consecutive days (**September 24 & 25, 2025**) from 1-3 PM ET.
- Hosted on **Vimeo** with live presentations, demos, and Q&A
- Materials and recordings will be made available after the sessions

---

## 🧠 Session Goals
- **Forum 1 – All About Metadata**  
  Participants will increase their knowledge and readiness for extending the utility of social science data beyond individual research projects as a crucial component for advancing the broader weather and hazard research ecosystem.
  
- **Forum 2 – From Metadata to Insights**  
  Participants will be introduced to practical tools and conceptual frameworks, such as Jupyter notebooks and FAIR principles, that facilitate the integration of social science data with physical science data for enhanced interdisciplinary insights.

---

## 💻 Hands-On Components
- Guided Jupyter notebook exercises
- Step-by-step examples you can adapt to your own research
- Downloadable Jupyter notebooks

---

## 🧩 **Come Prepared**  
To make the Data Forums more relevant for your work, we invite participants to reflect on the following as they engage in the Forums (see also [🧩 What to Bring](what-to-bring.md)):  

1. **Your Data Story**  
   - What kind of social, behavioral, economic, hazard, or climate-related data do you work with?  
   - What are your biggest integration challenges or opportunities?  
   - How well documented is your data? Could improving or enriching your **metadata** make integration easier?  
   - What new collaborations would you like to see?  

2. **Looking Ahead: A Dataset & a Question**  
   - After the Forums, begin thinking about a dataset you’ve created or worked with (real or hypothetical).  
   - Consider what new insights might come from combining it with other data sources.  
   - Reflect on what types of data (social, meteorological, environmental, etc.) could help answer those questions.  

💡 **Why This Matters**  
By keeping these reflections in mind during the Forums, you’ll be better positioned to:  
- Connect discussions to your own data and challenges  
- Recognize common opportunities across disciplines  
- See how metadata and documentation support collaboration  
- Carry forward ideas that could grow into future projects, partnerships, or even a **community directory or network map** to strengthen SBES connections  

---

## 🤝 Community Building
- Meet others in the **social, behavioral, and economic sciences** community working with hazard and weather data
- Share challenges, successes, and ideas for future collaboration
- Provide feedback to refine NOAA’s draft metadata standards

---

## 📌 By the end of the Forums, you’ll have:
1. **Practical experience** applying metadata to datasets  
2. **Example workflows** for reusing data alongside other sources  
3. **Connections** with peers in the SBES and weather/hazard research community  
4. A voice in shaping tools and standards to support future research
