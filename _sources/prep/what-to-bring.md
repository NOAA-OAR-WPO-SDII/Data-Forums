## ðŸ§© What to Keep in Mind  

As you participate in the Data Forums, keep your own **Data Story** and perspectives on integration in mind.  
Reflecting on these points during discussions will help you connect the sessions to your own work and see new opportunities.

### ðŸ“– Your Data Story  
Think of this as a brief mental sketch of your work with data. You do **not** need to prepare slides or a formal write-up â€” just consider these questions as you listen and engage:  

1. **The Data You Work With**  
   - What kinds of **social, behavioral, economic, hazard, or climate-related data** are part of your work?  
     _(Example: Public survey results on hurricane evacuation, NWS warning polygons, FEMA disaster claims, social media sentiment during severe weather events.)_  

2. **Integration Challenges or Opportunities**  
   - Where do you see the most potential for combining your data with other datasets?  
   - What technical, policy, or cultural barriers make integration difficult?  
     _(Example: Geospatial misalignment between survey areas and hazard data, restricted data access, lack of metadata.)_  

3. **Metadata**  
   - How well documented is your data? Are there ways you could **improve or enrich your metadata** to make integration easier for others?  

4. **Collaboration Interests**  
   - What types of partners or disciplines would you like to connect with?  
     _(Example: Partnering with atmospheric scientists to model public response to heat advisories, or with economists to quantify storm recovery impacts.)_

### ðŸ”­ Looking Ahead  
After the Data Forums, we encourage you to begin thinking about a **dataset and a question** that could spark deeper exploration. This isnâ€™t something to prepare in advance, but a way to carry the conversation forward:  

- **The Dataset**: What data (real or hypothetical) could you draw on in future collaborations? Whatâ€™s in it, and who maintains it?  
- **The Question**: What new insights might come from linking your dataset with other sources? What kinds of data would help answer that question?  
- **The Potential**: How could such integration expand the usefulness of your work or open opportunities for collaboration?

ðŸ’¡ **Why This Matters**  
By keeping your Data Story in mind, youâ€™ll be able to:  
- Connect Forum discussions to your own data and challenges  
- Recognize common integration opportunities across disciplines  
- Identify ways metadata and documentation could smooth collaboration  
- Carry ideas forward into post-Forum collaborations and projects
