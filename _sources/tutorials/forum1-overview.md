## Why Use Repositories? A Note on Open Science

Trusted repositories play an important role in **open science**, helping data stay **discoverable, preserved, and citable**. For example:  
- Repositories such as **generalist repositories** can assign persistent identifiers (like DOIs) and make reuse easier through open licensing and standardized metadata.  
- Services like **DataONE** provide ways to manage data workflows and connect with the FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable).  

These kinds of resources offer pathways to move beyond simply “learning about data” toward **sharing and integrating** data in ways that support your community.
