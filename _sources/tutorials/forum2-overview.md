# Forum 2 - From Metadata to Insights

**Forum 2: From Metadata to Insights** builds on the first session’s focus on metadata by showing how it can be put into practice through open science workflows. After a short recap, the forum begins with a brief talk introducing the role of metadata as a bridge between social science and hazard data, and how Jupyter notebooks can make these workflows transparent, shareable, and reproducible. A live demonstration follows, walking through a “cookbook” notebook that pulls data from an API, performs a basic transformation, and visualizes results, showing how researchers might begin linking their own datasets to weather and hazard information. The session concludes with group discussion and reflection on what would be needed to make participants’ data more integrable and how a broader community of practice could support this work.

**Duration:** 120 minutes (2 hours)
