# 🌐 SSP Overview

The **Social Science Program (SSP)** is part of NOAA’s **Weather Program Office (WPO)**, within the **Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research (OAR)**.  
SSP does not conduct research directly — instead, we **fund and foster research** that strengthens NOAA’s ability to deliver effective forecasts and warnings to the public.  

By understanding **societal needs** and **decision-making**, SSP ensures that forecast improvements translate into the **greatest possible societal benefit**.
