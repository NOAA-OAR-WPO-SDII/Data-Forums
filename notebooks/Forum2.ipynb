    "This tutorial is designed for social scientists who want to explore how their own data might begin to interface with weather and hazard datasets.  The tutorial will provide a quick overview of Jupyter notebooks and tools, some geospatial tools, and API access for environmental and weather data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Goals:\n",
    "1.  **Work with APIs** to search for, access, and download data programmatically\n",
    "2.  Organize, explore, and download datasets interactively using python libraries like **pandas** and **requests**.\n",
    "3.  Merge survey data with external data from the **Iowa Environmental Mesonet**\n",
    "4.  Apply **geospatial tools** to handle location-based data\n",
    "5.  Create clear, reproducible **visualizations** and **statistical analyses** directly alongside your analysis\n",
    "6.  Document our process in a way that combines code, results, and explanation all in one place  \n",
    "\n",
    "Note: Ensure that the datasets are open access, or you have an API key for restricted access.  For this example, the datasets in this notebook do not require an API key.\n"

    "### Why Do This?\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, the integration of weather and hazard data, and addressing both temporal and spatial resolutions, might allow for a deeper understanding of how people perceive, interpret, and respond to weather and climate risks in relation to the actual meteorological conditions they experience.  Fusing data in this way opens up a range of potential research questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. How accurately do people perceive the frequency or severity of extreme weather events in their area?\n",
    "2. Are there socioeconomic or demographic predictors of inaccurate weather risk perception?\n",
    "3. Do people who recall receiving more weather warnings perceive greater weather risk?\n",
    "4. Is there a mismatch between how meteorologists frame risk (as understood by watches and warnings) and how the public interprets it?\n",
    "5. Are individuals who have experienced extreme weather more likely to change their behavior or risk perception?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Think About Your Own Data (Respond in the chat)\n",

    "### Before We Get Started - Workplace Setup (Imports)\n",
    "\n",
    "In Jupyter, there are a large number of python-based \"libraries\" or \"packages\" that help with data loading, transformation, and analysis.  These libraries provide tools that help us do things like make graphs, work with data, or do more complex calculations, like regression.  It's good practice to have all libraries imported at the beginning.  You can always add (even install) libraries as you go along, you just have to rerun the cells (or restart the *kernel* if a new install).  \n",
    "\n",
    "To run a cell, you can go to \"Run\" in the Jupyter menu and select \"Run selected cell\".  However, it is easier to click on the chevron (▶️) in the editing menu.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, the primary libraries we will use are:\n",
    "\n",
    "*Data Handling*\n",
    "\n",
    "- **pandas**: For working with tabular data in DataFrames.  It is commonly imported with an alias (pd), so we don't constantly have to type out pandas.\n",
    "- **requests**: For easily fetching data from web APIs and URLs (using GET, POST, etc).\n",
    "- **timedelta**: Imported from the datetime library, for representing time intervals.\n",
    "- **BytesIO**: Imported from the IO library, for treating in-memory bytes like a file for reading.\n",
    "- **ast**: A python module which can be used for evaluating strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Geospatial*\n",
    "\n",
    "- **geopandas**: To work with geospatial data, allowing us to perform spatial operations and handle geometries such as points, polygons, and lines.\n",
    "- **Point**: Imported from Shapely, for creating geometric points for mapping.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Visualization*\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Pyplot**: Imported from MatPlotLib using the alias \"plt\", for making simple customizable  plots and charts.\n",
    "- **Seaborn**: Imported using the alias \"sns\", for making better looking visualizations.\n",
    "  \n",
    "*Utilities*\n",
    "\n",
    "- **time**: Provides functions for working with time, such as measuring durations, pausing executions, and accessing system time.\n",
    "- **tqdm**: Adds progress bars to loops for tracking execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Statistical Modeling/Inference*\n",
    "\n",
    "- **scipy.stats.chi2_contingency**: Imported from Scipy, to run a chi-square test of independence to check if two categorical variables are related.\n",
    "- **statsmodels.api as sm**: Imported with the alias \"sm\", it provides tools for statistical models, including logistic regression.\n",
    "- **OrderedModel**: Imported from statsmodels, used for ordinal logistic regression models when outcomes are ordered categories."

An API (Application Programming Interface) is just a set of rules and tools that allows different software to communicate and interact with each other.  In this case, we want our Jupyter notebook to interact with the server for information on datasets.  We use the python library \"Requests\" to simplify and automate our requests, and Dataverse returns what we requested (hopefully), typically in a format called JSON.  We then use Pandas to transform the JSON in a dataframe, making the results easier to read and manipulate.  \n",

    "   For each person, we:  \n",
    "   - Look up their latitude, longitude, and survey date.  \n",
    "   - Define a **3-day window** before their survey date (so we catch recent alerts).  \n",

    "4. **Ask the API for weather alerts.**  \n",
    "   - If the API responds successfully, we pull out the names of any alerts and save them in that person’s row.  \n",
    "   - If something goes wrong (bad connection, no data, etc.), we save an *empty list* for that person.  \n",
    "\n",
    "By the end, the survey dataset (`df_18`) has a new column called `wwa_names` that tells us which WWAs (if any) each respondent experienced around the time of their survey.  \n",

    "Respondents who were exposed to a flood WWA were less likely to report no risk (10% → 8%) or low risk (32% → 28%), and more likely to report higher levels of risk perception, particularly at the “High” (15% → 18%) and “Extreme” (9% → 11%) categories. While the percentage point changes may look modest, they indicate a clear upward shift in perceived flood risk among those who received WWAs.  In other words, I think it is possible to say that exposure to a flood warning nudged people away from saying ‘no risk’ and toward saying ‘high or extreme risk.  However, with only 3,000 responses, I probably wouldn't.  But, as the academics say, this requires further study. 😉\n",
