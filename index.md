# SSP Data Forums: Building a Connected, Data-Capable SBES Community

---

## 📢 About the Forums

Welcome to the **first annual SSP Data Forums**, an effort of the Social Science Program at **NOAA's Weather Program Office (WPO)**!  
These virtual sessions are the starting point for building a more connected, collaborative, and data-capable **Social, Behavioral, and Economic Sciences (SBES)** community within NOAA and across our partners.  

🗓 **When:** September 24 & 25, 2025 (1-3 PM ET) 
💻 **Where:** Virtual (Vimeo)  
🎯 **Focus:** Metadata standards, data integration tools, and fostering sustained community engagement.

## 📓 Jupyter Notebooks

A key part of the Data Forums is the use of **[Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org)** — a browser-based tool for producing computational narratives that combine:

- Code execution  
- Text & documentation  
- Mathematical notation  
- Images & videos  

Jupyter is a **powerful open-source tool** for scientific computing, reproducible research, and teaching data science.

Come join others in the **weather and hazard social science community** to explore these tools and apply them to your own work.
