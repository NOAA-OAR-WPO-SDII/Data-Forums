## 📢 About the Forums

Welcome to the **first annual SSP Data Forums**, an effort of the Social Science Program at **NOAA's Weather Program Office (WPO)**!  
These virtual sessions are the starting point for building a more connected, collaborative, and data-capable **Social, Behavioral, and Economic Sciences (SBES)** community within NOAA and across our partners.  

🗓 **When:** September 24 & 25, 2025  
💻 **Where:** Virtual (Vimeo)  
🎯 **Focus:** Metadata standards, data integration tools, and fostering sustained community engagement.

| **Objectives** <br> 1. Introduce and apply draft metadata standards  <br> 2. Highlight how metadata supports discovery, interoperability, and reuse  <br> 3. Provide hands-on metadata application using Jupyter notebooks  <br> 4. Gather feedback to refine standards | **Objectives** <br> 1. Demonstrate reuse of SBES data alongside weather/climate datasets  <br> 2. Walk through a reproducible, transparent workflow in a Jupyter notebook  <br> 3. Encourage adoption of integration-ready data practices |

## 🧩 What to Bring

Come ready to share your **Data Story** and ideas for integration!

- **Your Data Story**  
  What kind of social, behavioral, or hazard-related data do you work with?  
  What are your biggest integration challenges or opportunities?  
  What new collaborations would you like to see?  

- **A Dataset & a Question**  
  Think of a dataset you’ve created or worked with (real or hypothetical).  
  Pose a question that could be answered by combining it with additional data sources.

💡 We’ll use these reflections to kick off Forum 1 and spark collaboration across the community.

## 📝 Code of Conduct

We are committed to creating a welcoming, inclusive environment for all participants.  
Please review our [**Code of Conduct**](code-of-conduct.md) to understand the community guidelines for the SSP Data Forums.

## 📓 Jupyter Notebooks

A key part of the Data Forums is the use of **[Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org)** — a browser-based tool for producing computational narratives that combine:

- Code execution  
- Text & documentation  
- Mathematical notation  
- Images & videos  

Jupyter is a **powerful open-source tool** for scientific computing, reproducible research, and teaching data science.

Come join others in the **weather and hazard social science community** to explore these tools and apply them to your own work.
